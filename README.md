Dining Philosophers Problem

N number of silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Philosophers have to alternate between thinking and eating.

Constraints of the problem:
-philosophers can only eat when they have a fork on each hand
-only one philosopher at most can be holding a given fork at any given time
-when philosopher's aren't eating, they're thinking

Other things to consider:
-starvation
-fairness
